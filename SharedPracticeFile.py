# answer to the teachers hint (If you had a cup of coffie and a glass of milk how would you switch them?)
# answer: place the contents of one cup into a new cup and do the same for the remaining cup. This will give you 4
# cups in total. Then switch and place the contents of the opposite cup into the two first cups
# answer was almost correct 1 too many cups
# How the computer read the code a = input("a: ") grabs a: and runs input after user input (3) variable a is now 3
# same is done for b = input("b: ") b (5) b is 5. next line a1 = b then a1 = 5 b1 = 3
# next line- a = b1 b1 is 3 so a now equals 3, next line- b = a1 a1 = 5 so b = 5
# next line- print("a: " + a) computer sees print command reads whats in parenthesis and reads from left to right
# a: + a reduced to a: 3 then reads the print command and prints a: 3
# next line- print("b: " + b) computer sees print command, encapsulates the whole command, moves inside the parenthesis,
# reads from left to right, b:, executes concatenation (str b: + 5 = b: 5), moves to print command, executes print,
# end result b: 5
# day 1 final project

# cityName = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? \n")  # read: What's the name of the city you grew up in?,
# brakes line, executes input, cityName = input
# petName = input("What's your pet's name? \n")  # read: What's your pet's name?, breaks line, executes input,
# petName = input
# print("Your band name could be " + cityName + " " + petName)  # read: Your band name could be, concatenates cityName,
# concatenates " ", concatenates petName, Your band name could be cityName petName, executes print, compilation finished
